3,N/A,Education,Child care subsidies,Included in Budget bill,pass,,,,,Lola Duffort,"The state's budget this year included a $7.4 million package for child care. The bulk of that is a $5.7 million boost for child care subsidies.

The bill would go into effect Oct 1, 2020 and was largely targeted at the telecommunications industry. A similar bill was vetoed by Gov.

There was an appetite in the Senate to see it pass this session, but House leadership did not view it as a top priority.

The Senate gave the governor the authority to appoint the adjutant general, while the bill passed by the House, H. 530, kept the power to pick with lawmakers.

18,S.157,Politics,Ethics commission,Stalled in committee,fail,,,,,Mark Johnson,"There was little appetite to expand the powers of the state Ethics Commission. Some lawmakers felt the fledgling commission had overstepped its authority when it issued an advisory opinion about Gov. Phil Scott last year. The commission ruled Scott had a continuing conflict of interest because a construction company he co-owned, Dubois Construction—which does business with the state—owes him money from selling his share. Some lawmakers wanted to give the commission investigatory powers, but lawmakers balked at that idea.",https://vtdigger.org/2019/03/14/lawmakers-seek-to-modify-ethics-commission-procedures-after-scott-ruling/
19,S.23,Economy,Minimum wage,Stalled in conference committee,fail,,,,,Xander Landen,"Democrats failed to pass an increase to Vermont’s minimum hourly wage this year after the two chambers couldn’t find common ground. In the bill S.23, the Senate initially pushed for a $15 wage by 2020, but the House's watered down version wouldn’t reach $15 until at least 2026 (and likely even later). In the end, the Senate tried to get House lawmakers to agree to a $12.50 minimum wage by 2021. The House did not agree. ",https://vtdigger.org/tag/s-23/

The House passed a paid leave bill, H.107, that offered workers 12 weeks of parental leave, and eight weeks to care for ill family members, or take care of their own medical issues. To reduce the cost, the Senate scaled back the number of weeks offered and eliminated leave time for personal medical issues.  No agreement could be reached.",https://vtdigger.org/tag/h-107/
21,H.162,Health Care,Buprenorphine decriminalization,Stalled in committee,fail,,,,,Xander Landen,"Some House members pushed to decriminalize buprenorphine, a prescription drug used to quell opioid withdrawal symptoms.

23,PR.5,Health Care,Abortion constitutional amendment,Needs approval next biennium,waiting,106,38,28,2,Xander Landen,"Lawmakers also passed a proposed amendment to the state Constitution that would enshrine a woman’s right to an abortion into state law: Proposal 5.

President Pro Tem Tim Ashe, D/P-Chittenden, announced before the session that passing a constitutional amendment to extend Vermont governor terms from two to four years was a top priority.

27,N/A,Spending items,Reach Up assistance program,Included in Budget bill,pass,,,,,Xander Landen,"Budget writers considered staffing reductions at Reach Up, a financial assistance program for low income families, which has seen less demand in recent years.

But as it stands now, the deduction – removed by lawmakers during extensive tax reform in 2018 – would be largely restored.
